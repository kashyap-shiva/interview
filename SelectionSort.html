Definition and Algorithm Steps:
<!-- 
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending
on sorting order) element from the unsorted portion of the array and moves it to the sorted portion.

1.) Start with the first element as the minimum.
2.) Compare the current element with the rest of the elements in the unsorted portion of the array.
3.) If a smaller element is found, update the minimum.
4.) After the iteration, swap the minimum element with the current element.
5.) Move to the next position and repeat until the entire array is sorted. -->
