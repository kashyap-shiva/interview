Defintion and Steps :

<!-- Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm for small datasets. It works by building a 
sorted portion of the array one element at a time. Each new element is inserted into the correct 
position relative to the already sorted portion.

Algorithm Steps:
Start from the second element (index 1) and assume the first element (index 0) is already sorted.
Compare the current element with elements in the sorted portion.
Shift all elements larger than the current element one position to the right.
Insert the current element into its correct position.
Repeat for all elements until the array is fully sorted. -->
